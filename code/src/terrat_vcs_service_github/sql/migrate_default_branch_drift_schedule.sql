-- Migrate a legacy default-branch sentinel row: copy (repo, '', name) to (repo, branch, name)
-- and delete the sentinel row, in one statement so no crash can leave either a lost schedule
-- or a half-migrated pair. An existing explicit-name row wins: ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING keeps
-- a fresh push's fields over the legacy row's, and the sentinel row is deleted either way.
-- last_tried_at is copied so the migrated row does not re-fire the slot that just ran.
