(** [revoke_login_sessions ?except user db] deletes every browser login session ([kind = 'login']

    {!revoke_tenant} call this themselves; callers that write [users.capabilities] directly must
    call it in the same transaction. API tokens are deliberately untouched: capabilities limit what
    tokens a user can create, not what an already-minted token can do.

    [except] keeps one login row, by id. Pass it only for a strictly widening change: the kept
    snapshot is then merely under-privileged until the next sign-in, and the acting user is not
    logged out mid-request for a change that only gave them something. *)

(** [grant_tenant ~grants ~tenant_id user db] adds [tenant_id] to each of the user's named
    tenant-scoped capabilities, creating one scoped to that tenant alone when absent, and returns
    the stored result (the effective one, i.e. the one unioned with the groups rules).

    The row is locked for the read-modify-write, so this must run inside a transaction — together
    with the matching {!Sgs_tenant.add_user}. Membership and capability are the two halves of one
    authorization decision and must not drift.

    [except_login_session] is forwarded to {!revoke_login_sessions}: pass the acting user's own
    login-session id so the widening grant does not log them out. *)

(** [revoke_tenant ~grants ~tenant_id user db] takes [tenant_id] out of each of the user's named
    tenant-scoped capabilities. A scope holds a refusal as readily as an allowance, so this always
    succeeds: taking one tenant out of an installation-wide grant leaves every other tenant in it.

    That is more than a tenant-scoped endpoint may ask for. Narrowing a grant that covers more than
    the tenant in hand rewrites authority the caller does not own, and demotes an installation
    administrator without the guard that keeps the last one — so the membership endpoints refuse it
    first, on {!Sgs_service_tenants_members_common.wider_grant}.

    There is deliberately no [except_login_session] escape hatch here, unlike {!grant_tenant}: the
    kept session would go on authorizing the right this call just took away. A caller revoking a
    right from themselves is logged out so that the revokation is visibly immediate.

    The effective (i.e. the one unioned with the group rules) updated capability is returned. *)

    Answers [`Would_remove_last_instance_admin_err] when [target_user_id] holds the only
    unrestricted grant, and [`Not_found_user_err] when no active user has that id. Only the
    unrestricted grant counts, on both sides: a tenant-scoped admin is not what is being protected.

    [f] runs inside the guard's transaction, holding the lock that serializes installation-admin
    mutations, so that the count and the write it authorizes cannot be separated — without it two
    demotions of two different administrators each read the other as their replacement and both
    commit, leaving zero. See [sql/lock_instance_admins.sql]. That transaction is this function's
    own: it must not be called from inside another, which {!Pgsql_io.tx} answers by raising. *)

(** [set_instance_admin admin ~f db target_user_id] writes [admin] to [target_user_id] and then runs
    [f] in the same transaction, so a caller writing more than the grant lands all of it or none of
    it, and reads the grant back through anything [f] does.

    [`Instance_admin] writes the unrestricted [admin] scope, replacing a tenant-scoped one.
    [`No_admin] clears the [admin] scope only when it is unrestricted: a tenant-scoped grant is left
    as it is, and on a user who holds no grant the write changes nothing.

    When the write changes either capability column, both are written and every login session the
    target holds is revoked (see {!revoke_login_sessions}). When it changes nothing, nothing is
    written and no session is revoked. Answers [`Not_found_user_err] when no active user has that
    id.

    The transaction is this function's own on both paths, so like {!guard_last_instance_admin} it
    must not be called from inside another one. *)
